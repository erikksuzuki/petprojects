    "Aces always stand for great power, but power in its latent form – the seed or root of great possibilities, of great force waiting to be expressed. Wands represent one’s spiritual aspirations, creative energy, hopes and desires. They are the symbol of ambition, enthusiasm and enterprise, but focused on the higher aspects of life, not the mundane.",
    "The natural tendency of the human soul is to evolve, to become more conscious, to fly, to grow and realize the fullness of Self. This is what the Ace of Wands is all about. However, the emphasis is on natural force as opposed to invoked force. This means that power comes naturally when one is in tune with self and environment, and not blindly trying to force one’s own desires to become reality.",
    "The image of the wand here shows a figure in the process of breaking free, discovering his wings, ready to soar to the heights of his being. His navel bears the blood-red triangle of the manipura chakra, the seat of the will, but this relationship to will is very subtle. It is the will in tune with natural power. The ghost of this triangular symbol is formed again by his arms and head, as he prepares to transcend his limitations and fly. The whole image is one of an adapted caduceus of creative fire. The serpent or Kundalini power passes through the lower chakras and now the aspirant is at the point of leaping the abyss, to the higher chakras, towards fulfilment."

    "Traditionally this card has been called Justice. In the western world, justice is a concept which has been degraded over centuries until it is now loaded with a sense of legal punishment or retribution. The Sanskrit term, Karma, which is now a word with global currency, is more suitable for providing both the broad brushstrokes and the subtle nuances of thought that this trump requires. In this particular image, two different oriental traditions have been brought together. They are the weighing of the soul from Egyptian mythology, and the Buddhist idea of karmic reincarnation.",
    "Buddhist thought has expressed the idea of karma thus: deeds which are motivated by acts of will are, in general, morally good or morally bad. These deeds produce ‘fruit’. The deed leaves a psychic trance on the person committing the act. This trace leads him or her in the direction determined by the action. This is destiny. When the fruit is ripe it falls, taking effect on the person responsible. The length of time thought necessary for the fruits of most significant actions to ripen is more than one lifetime, thereby creating the need for the continuing of life, death and rebirth.",
    "The Egyptian Book of the Dead tells us that the deceased is led into the Hall of Two Truths. His heart is then weighed in the scales against the feather of truth, known as Maat. Maat was also the name of the goddess of law, truth and justice, so this is a case of an abstraction being personified as a deity. The goddess Maat sits vigilantly wearing an ostrich feather and bearing a sword. If the heart is heavier than the feather, the deceased soul is found guilty and is devoured by a monster, a hybrid animal, suggesting in the Buddhist context that further incarnations into the crudities of physical life are still needed.",
    "The seated figure who dominates the center of the card is one of the Taras from Buddhist tradition. The nature of karma implies that for every action there is an equal reaction. This is the essential quality of balance. So the Tara is mirrored by her own reflection, as is all the imagery around her. Light becomes dark. The sun mirrors the moon. This explains the Egyptians’ term ‘the Hall of Two Truths’. The Tara bestows her blessing and undertakes to ensure that no one is overlooked in the grand scheme of things. She has numerous all-seeing eyes, most particularly the eye of enlightenment in the forehead and the eyes in the palms, symbol of mercy, which balance the cold sword of detachment wielded by the goddess Maat.",
    "Her astrological sign can only be Libra. This tells us that what is necessary are the decisions of a balanced mind. There must be discrimination in action. Decisions are not to be made expediently.",
    "On a mundane level one might see the conclusion or effect of court cases and legal disputes. Do not let a sense of injustice cloud your own thinking and affect your own integrity of action. How you ‘handle’ energy at this time is of great significance. Immerse yourself in the energy of your decisions. Dispel negative thoughts."
